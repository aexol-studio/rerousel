## How to use?

1. Install the package using npm

```
npm install rerousel
```

2. Import rerousel in the component you want to use it

```tsx
import { Rerousel } from 'rerousel';
```

3. Place it in the desired position and fill it with the items you want to showcase

```tsx
export const Component: React.FC<CustomersProps> = ({ customers }) => {
    const customerLogo = useRef(null);

    return (
        <Container>
            <Rerousel itemRef={customerLogo}>
                {customers.map((c) => {
                    return <Img key={c.image} image={c.image} ref={customerLogo} />;
                })}
            </Rerousel>
        </Container>
    );
};
```

4. Create a ref pointing at your outermost item inside of the rerousel and include it in the Rerousel as **"itemRef"** prop.
